## Search translated Korean words from database

### How to use:
As you can tell, the data file isn't there and that's because it can't be public. However, any .json file structured like the following will have no issues running.

```
[
  {
    "kr": "enter korean phrase here",
    "eng": "enter english phrase here"
  },
]
```

Running `search.py` is the main body and it's pretty simple and self-explanitory.

You can either search a Korean phrase to look for how it was translated in English 
or you can add a new word to your .json file in the terminal.

In order to exit an option, you will want to type `back` to go back to the main menu.
